# Me vs AI Python Lab
This repository documents my Python learning journey by solving problems and comparing solutions.

Each task is organized in its own folder.

Example:

tasks/
  task01/
    me_task01.py     → My original solution
    ai_task01.py     → AI improved / alternative solution
    notes.md         → Learning notes and comparison analysis

## Purpose

- Improve Python programming skills
- Compare human vs AI problem solving approaches
- Track mistakes and improvements
- Learn better coding practices and design patterns

## Learning Method

For every task:

1. Solve the problem manually
2. Generate an AI solution or improvement
3. Compare both solutions
4. Document learnings inside notes.md
