# Me vs AI Python Lab
This repository documents my Python learning journey by solving problems and comparing solutions.

## Structure

Each task is organised in its own folder.

Example:

- `me_task01.py` → My original solution  
- `ai_task01.py` → AI improved / alternative solution  
- `notes.md` → Learning notes and comparison analysis

## Purpose

- Improve Python programming skills
- Compare human vs AI problem-solving approaches
- Track mistakes and improvements
- Learn better coding practices and design patterns

## My Learning Method

For every task:

1. Solve the problem manually
2. Generate an AI solution or improvement
3. Compare both solutions
4. Document learnings inside `notes.md`
